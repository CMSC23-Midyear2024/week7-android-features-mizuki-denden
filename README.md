# Week 7: Android Features and Utilities

## Code Description

This code enables the user to add and delete contact from Contact List. For adding a contact, the first name and a phone number is required. <br/>
Although not required, this code allows the user to upload an image (from camera) as a profile picture. 

## Things you did in the code

What I did was implement some of the methods needed from the flutter_contacts package in pub.dev <br/>
For the Forms, I only implemented the Forms and TextField widgets to capture the users input. 

## Challenges encountered

The most challenging for me, before discovering the given methods in pub.dev, was setting the data from the textfields into a Contact.
